**Xenoglot: A Comprehensive Language Data Management Toolkit**

Xenoglot is a comprehensive library for representing, managing, and interacting with language data. It provides a rich set of classes and interfaces for representing languages, dialects, scripts, language families, and regions. The library also includes methods for obtaining language tags, checking language usage patterns, and territorializing languages. Xenoglot is essential for any project that requires accurate and consistent handling of language data.

**Key Features**

* **Comprehensive Language Representation:** Xenoglot provides a structured representation of languages, dialects, scripts, language families, and regions, enabling accurate and consistent handling of language data.

* **Language Tag Generation:** Xenoglot provides methods for generating language tags, facilitating interoperability with language-related protocols and standards.

* **Language Usage Analysis:** Xenoglot includes methods for checking language usage patterns, enabling informed decisions about language selection and content localization.

* **Language Territorialization:** Xenoglot provides functionality for territorializing languages, adapting them to specific geographical or political contexts.

**Kotlin Multiplatform Support**

Xenoglot is designed to work across various platforms through Kotlin Multiplatform, allowing you to use it in JVM, Android, JavaScript, iOS, macOS, Linux, tvOS, and watchOS environments. Here are some of the supported targets:

- **JVM**: Supports Java Virtual Machine with Kotlin configured for JDK 11.
- **Android**: Configured to publish all library variants.
- **JavaScript**: Supports WebAssembly (WASM) and JavaScript IR, including browser and Node.js environments, and generates TypeScript definitions.
- **iOS**: Supports iOS devices and simulators, including `iosX64`, `iosArm64`, and `iosSimulatorArm64`.
- **macOS**: Supports macOS with `macosX64` and `macosArm64`.
- **Linux**: Supports Linux with `linuxX64` and `linuxArm64`.
- **tvOS**: Supports tvOS devices and simulators, including `tvosX64`, `tvosArm64`, and `tvosSimulatorArm64`.
- **watchOS**: Supports watchOS devices and simulators, including `watchosX64`, `watchosArm32`, `watchosArm64`, `watchosDeviceArm64`, and `watchosSimulatorArm64`.

**Installation**

To install Xenoglot, add the following dependency to your build script:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation(platform("dev.teogor.xenoglot:bom:1.0.0-alpha01"))
  implementation("dev.teogor.xenoglot:android")
  implementation("dev.teogor.xenoglot:core")

  // or without bom
  implementation("dev.teogor.xenoglot:core:1.0.0-alpha01")
}
```

**Usage**

The following examples demonstrate how to use Xenoglot to represent and interact with language data:

**Retrieving Language Information**

```kotlin
val language = Language.English
val languageTag = language.languageTag
val languageFamily = language.languageFamily
val isSpokenInRomania = language.isSpokenIn(Country.Romania)
```

**Checking Language Usage Patterns**

```kotlin
val isDialect = Dialect("en-US", Language.English).isDialect
val isScriptUsedInLanguage = Script.Cyrillic.isWrittenIn(Language.Russian)
```

**Territorializing Languages**

```kotlin
val dialect = Language.English.territorialize(Country.Australia)
val dialectLanguageTag = dialect.languageTag
val dialectCountryCode = dialect.country.code
```

**Benefits of Using Xenoglot**

* **Improved Language Handling:** Xenoglot provides a consistent and structured approach to managing language data, reducing errors and inconsistencies.

* **Enhanced Interoperability:** Xenoglot facilitates interoperability with language-related protocols and standards, enabling seamless integration with external systems.

* **Simplified Language-Related Tasks:** Xenoglot streamlines language-related tasks, such as localization, translation, and language detection.

* **Promote Language-Aware Development:** Xenoglot encourages language-aware development practices, ensuring that language data is handled accurately and appropriately.

**Getting Started**

To get started with Xenoglot, refer to the comprehensive documentation available at
[source.teogor.dev/xenoglot](https://source.teogor.dev/xenoglot). The documentation provides
detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for using the library effectively.

## Pluralization Support

The `xenoglot-pluralization` module offers comprehensive support for pluralization, allowing you to manage
and format strings based on quantities. This feature helps in correctly displaying text for
different numbers of items, adapting to various pluralization rules.

### Quick Start

To get started with pluralization:

1. **Create Plural Forms**: Define templates for different plural categories (e.g., zero, one, few,
   many).
2. **Retrieve Formatted Strings**: Use methods to get the appropriate string for specific
   quantities.

Here's a brief example:

```kotlin
val pluralForms = createPluralForms(
    zeroTemplate = "No items",
    oneTemplate = "One item",
    twoTemplate = "Two items",
    fewTemplate = "%d items",
    manyTemplate = "%d items",
    otherTemplate = "%d items",
)

println(pluralForms.getQuantityString(5))  // Output: "5 items"
```

For a more detailed guide on how to use pluralization effectively, please refer to
the [Pluralization Module Documentation](docs/pluralization-guide.md).
